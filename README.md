# Smart Study Assistant

## Overview

The AI Study Assistant is a web-based application designed to generate study materials based on the entered input. It is built using Streamlit and is connected to Google Cloud Vertex AI, allowing it to use artificial intelligence models to process and understand information.
The main goal of this tool is to make learning easier by automatically organizing and summarizing study materials. Instead of manually reading through long chapters or notes, users can upload text or images, such as pictures of textbook pages or handwritten class notes. The application then analyzes this content and generates clear, structured study outputs that are easier to understand.
The AI Study Assistant uses the Gemini 2.5 Flash model to quickly process both written text and visual inputs. Based on the uploaded material, the tool can produce organized summaries, key points, and other helpful study content. 

## Features

The AI Study Assistant includes a range of features that are designed to make studying easier and more efficient. Users can upload different types of study materials, including plain text, images of textbook pages, and photos of handwritten notes. The application processes this input and converts it into organized and easy-to-read study content. The output focuses on highlighting important ideas and concepts, helping users understand the material without having to go through everything manually. The clean and simple user interface ensures that users can interact with the application without any confusion.
